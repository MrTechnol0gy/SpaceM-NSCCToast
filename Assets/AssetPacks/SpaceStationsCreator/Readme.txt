Build Your Own Space Stations
You can build your own space stations by quickly modifying the examples located in the Examples Modular scene inside the space stations folder. In addition, you can also assemble your own space stations from scratch by opening up the modules scene and moving/rotating/scaling and duplicating the modules until you have something you are happy with.

Folders & Bonus Content
The main package is the space stations and its modules, but we have additionally added a smaller space stations pack (bonus space stations), debris, crates and space objects that you could use in different combinations to build elaborate space scenes.

Main & Parts
To increase the texture resolution for the space stations, we have serparated the space station modules into main and parts, each has its own materials and textures.

Substance Painter
We included the Painter files for the Space Stations Creator pack, we didn't include the additional bonus content Painter files to reduce the final file size and make it easier for users to download.

Scenes 
A common theme throughout our packs is the existence of three types of scenes: examples, examples modular and modules. 
-The modules scenes contains the parts you need to start building something from scratch.
-Examples modular, have the examples built from modules so you are able to modify and move the parts easily.
-Examples, are the same as examples modular except that meshes have been baked (combined/attached as in using something like mesh baker).
